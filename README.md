# Reading Notes

This site is where I keep my reading notes from the material I study while I'm learning to code at Code Fellows!

### About Me
<em>Hello!</em> My name is Faustino Marco, you can call me Marco. Thanks for visiting my new webpage! 

> I'm currently studying software development with a focus in Advanced Python programming. My background is in the service industry, where I spent almost 10 years honing technical and interpersonal skills that make me a great speaker, listener, and compassionate confidante. I have a knack for foreign language acquisition and I love to travel and learn about our planet and the people living on it. I want to help others, and outside of the volunteer work I do I want to serve my community and the world at large by making use of my ability to listen, learn fast, create and implement plans. I want programming to become the medium through which I help others change the world.
