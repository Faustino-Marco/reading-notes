Hello! My name is Faustino Marco, you can call me Marco. Thanks for visiting my new webpage!

### Growth Mindset

*Growth Mindset* is an ideology to embrace in a holistic and comprehensive manner both personally and professionally.
As opposed to *fixed* mindset, *Growth Mindset* provides a flexible and encouraging way to view life and its challenges, reframing archaic and limiting belief systems that, until recently, have governed the status quo in education and societal progress as a whole.

Here are a handful of reminders for myself that embrace ***Growth Mindset***.

1. Reminder One

   - Instead of telling myself ~~I can't do this~~, I must remember that I can do anything I set my mind to, and that help is available to those who ask for it.

2. Reminder Two

   - Challenges are opportunities for growth!

3. Reminder Three

   - No one is perfect, perfection is the nemesis of progress.
