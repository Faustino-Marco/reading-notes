### Growth Mindset

*Growth Mindset* is an ideology to embrace personally and professionally as a means to holistically liberate people from their limiting beliefs and stagnating mores.

As opposed to *fixed* mindset, *Growth Mindset* provides a flexible and encouraging way to view life and its challenges. 

The concept reframes archaic belief systems that have underscored the status quo in education and societal progress for centuries, which have held many people to the belief that their capacity for intelligence is unchangeable.

Here are a handful of reminders for myself that embrace ***Growth Mindset***.

1. Reminder One

   - Instead of telling myself ~~I can't do this~~, I must remember that I can do anything I set my mind to, and that help is available to those who ask for it.

2. Reminder Two

   - Challenges are opportunities for growth!

3. Reminder Three

   - No one is perfect, perfection is the nemesis of progress.

- [x]    On the main page: Explain "growth mindset" in your own words
- [x]    Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
- [x]    Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your page
