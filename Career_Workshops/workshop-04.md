- Recruiters look at resumes quickly
    - It's important to keep in mind the fact that recruiters examine hundreds, if not thousands, of resumes and ours should be designed with that in mind. 
    - Buzz words, statistics & figures, deliverables, and what we learned should be conveyed efficiently!
- Spamming them with emails is not good
    - Don't spam recruiters. It's ok to follow them on LinkedIn and reach out to connect and even network over the phone or zoom, but pestering is a bad look!
- You should demand a reasonable salary
    - if asked to name a salary, use a normal pay that's in range for that kind of work. Find a way to compare the salary in question to the normal salary range.

- Try the company's product/service
    - This has been something that's helped me throughout my career already, though I never put it into these terms. Being able to speak to the customer or client-side of the business with details and personal experience is a huge plus!
- Identify your selling points for this job
    - Curate the skills, accomplishments, and interview answers that you're practicing for each interview to resonate with your interviewers for that particular job
- Write down questions you'll ask them
    - I don't plan (at least as of today) to target any companies that I'm not interested in enough to have some exciting questions for. *Prepare more than you think you'll need*
