  first draft!
  - My name is Marco, I’m a software developer based out of Seattle with advanced training in Python programming and full-stack Javascript web development, specifically in the MERN stack. In school I excelled in mathematics and foreign language; as a child I reached fluency in German after only three years, for example, and since then I’ve been obsessed with learning new languages and traveling. I’ve lived in four countries between three continents and spent the last ten years in international hospitality management and cocktail bartending. As a professional I thrive on culturally diverse teams that have a lot to teach me right from the start. I do my best work when I can interact directly with clients, customers, and anyone else my role is designed to support. Right now in my job search, I’m looking for a fast-moving technology company that’s rapidly growing and ready to let me tackle new challenges and further expand my own base of knowledge.
