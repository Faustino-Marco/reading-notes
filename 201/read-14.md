## Google Teams Research

- Google discovers massive disparity in work/meeting time spent by employee base
  - Seeks to build perfect team/understand team dynamics further
- Long-standing belief that best teams are comprised of best people
- Project Aristotle reviews tons of data and makes a lackluster discovery, a lack of correlation between individual talent average and team success
- Take into account psycho-social factors, emotional elements of work-life and personal lives
- Divide research into two basic categories
- Team A
  - Best people together, lead from top
  - less open communication
  - less collaboration
  - less "psychological safety"
- Team B
  - sensitive to one another's moods
  - team members speak as much as is needed
  - might not contain as many individual stars, but "sum will be greater than its parts"
  - concept of "psychological safety" ties it all together
  - deeply emotional/vulnerable discussions lead to cohesion in teams
