I thought the panel had great advice to give regarding entry-level job seekers. I think the elements from the hour that had the greatest impact on me were Josh's remarks on working somewhere that has goals and a mission that you believe in. I hadn't really considered that up until this point. IT is everywhere nowadays, after all, and there is a huge breadth of companies I can choose to apply to based on how invested I am in what they do. So far I've been pretty focused on earning potential as far as my thoughts about my first job go. Which leads me to the second highly impactful nugget I got from todays talk which was the disclosure of the team's first-job-salaries, very encouraging stuff. I still have my doubts about what I'll be able to ask for given that I only have an associate's degree but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it!
