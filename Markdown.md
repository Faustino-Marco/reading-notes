# Markdown

This is where I'll write notes about Markdown.

## Format

This page will be written as notes in outline form.

### Basics

Markdown is a language that has been created to efficiently produce web pages and get content onto a webpage without having to worry too much about the correct use of HTML for each piece of text. 

Using *Markdown* I've successfully drafted everything you've read so far on this page quickly and without having to check for any errors I might have made indenting or annotating my content.

Using combinations of symbols, Markdown manages stylistic decisions like when to use *italics*, **bold text**, or ***both*** with ease.

### Headings Are A Breeze In Markdown, Too

Simply ordering the quantitiy of '#' symbols in front of a line of text dictates the size of the heading.

Other format and stylistic choices are made pretty simple in Markdown, too.

For example, i can easily quote a childhood hero of mine and embed said quote in the text.

> "To infinity, and beyond!" -Buzz Lightyear

If I wanted to write a piece of text that ought to stand alone I can make that happen in Markdown as well.

```
...like so.
```

These stylistic commands make it simple to pack a visual punch in a quick and easy way.

#### Tips and Tricks from Class Reading-Material

Something I learned from the text is how to create a checklist. Below are the items we needed to include on our first reading notes pages:

- [x]    Your site should exist at https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/
- [x]    The "source" for your site should be a README.md file, written with Markdown
- [x]    On the main page: Explain "growth mindset" in your own words
- [x]    Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
- [x]    Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your page
- [x]    Be sure to introduce yourself, and include a link to your GitHub portfolio page
