## Commands

- pwd
    - this command tells you where you are in the terminal, or which directory you're in.
- ls
    - this displays what directories are inside the one you're currently in (list) 

`ls [options][location]`
    - ls command has more to it that `pwd` 

    - command `ls -l` gives you a "long listing" 

        - first character "-" indicates normal file 
        - first character "d" indicates directory 
        - next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory 
        - next field is the number of blocks 
        - next field is owner of file or directory 
        - next field is group the -/d belongs to 
        - following is the file size 
        - next is file modification time
