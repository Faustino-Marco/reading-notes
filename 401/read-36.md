- One thing I haven't seen a lot of advice about is the ways a candidate can really impress or go above and beyond in a technical interview. I'm left to assume that technical interviews will be so hard that impressing someone should be the least of my priorities, and I should try to just not drown. I'm not a huge fan of this ideology but if that's really how it is I also haven't seen any validation for that concept.
