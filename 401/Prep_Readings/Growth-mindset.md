## Emotional Intelligence / Biases

I feel confident that my emotional intelligence is, though imperfect, on a healthy track and almost always improving. I'm a highly empathetic individual and lately the opportunity for growth I've been most focued on is the integration of an understanding 'ego' and its role in our relationships with others. Selflessness can be a productive primary factor in problem solving, but I think this is more of an accute solution rather than a global application we should strive for. Too often, I think, people that are empathetic, and thereby choose selfless approaches to their problems, become exhausted and left feeling underappreciated or undervalued despite having given so much of themselves. Protecting myself from exterior threats to my focus and goals in a healthy way is my latest objective and I'm still learning about how to approach and delegate through important decisions in relationships and on teams. 
As for bias, I'm aware of the concept of bias and its affect on people and their relationships to one another. I see that there's bias to be addressed in my life, though I find the code fellows assessments of bias to be particularly leading, I value the practice of assessing one's own biases in an attempt to better understand who we show up as on teams and in our relationships.
