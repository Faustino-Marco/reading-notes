## [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://anthony-moore.medium.com/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-6ab2302b8e8c)
- most people waste and undervalue their time
- What would it change if your time was worth $1k/hr
  - people around you
  - problems
```
"Being busy is a form of mental laziness." - Tim Ferris
```

  - time is akin to money in that we must budget it 
  - successul people are focused, not busy

```
“Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.” - Seneca
```

Busyness is weakness!

- take steps toward your goals, don't just fill time
- teach people how to treat you
- You can do amazing things, but only if you have time to do them.
- say 'no' more
  - "...focus means saying no to 100+ other good ideas." - Jobs
"Living in a frenzy is a sign we've squandered too much." -Nikolas Goke



## [How to think like a programmer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

- "Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think." - Jobs
- trial and error vs. 
```
“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.

Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)
```
- steps to problem-solve
  - Understand
    - "If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it." -Feynman
  - Plan  
    - exact steps
    - answer this question:
      - Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?
      - COMMENTS!
  - Divide
    - Most important
      - Break into sub-problems
      - begin with simplest
        - 1st: already know answer
        - next: this problem doesn't depend on others being solved
      - Connect dots after solving sub-problems
  - Stuck?
    - be curious about bugs/errors, not upset
    - "art of debugging = figuring out what you told your program to do, vs. what you thought you told it to do." -Singer
  - Chess!

## [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
- Common mistakes
  - 'Measure twice, cut once.'
  - start coding asap
  - Steps
    1. Read problem completely, twice. 
    2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    3. Optimize the manual steps.
      - conversion to pseudo-code
    4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. 
    5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real gode. 
    6. Optimize the real code. 
      - eliminate duplication
    - spend 70% time on 1-3
    - be sure you totally understand the problem
    - math induction strategy 
      - solve for 1, 2, n
    - optimize pseudo-code/algo asap

## [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)
- Origins
  - Sakichi Toyoda
    - drilling down to root of any problem with 5 why's 
1. Assemble a Team
  - gather people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem and process to be fixed
  - include someone to act as a facilitator, who keeps team focused in identifying effective counter-measures

2. Define the problem
  - single brief, clear statement
    - "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets"
    - "software release B resulted in too many rollback failures
  - then write on whiteboard with enough room for "why?'s"
3. Ask the first 'why?'
4. Ask 'why?' four more times.
  - multiple lanes possible (images on page)
5. Know when to stop
6. Address Root causes
  - discuss/agree on count-er measures to prevent problem from re-occurring
7. Monitor your measures
  - keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem, amend/replace as needed, repeat 5 why's as needed.   

## [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)
- Mark Rober
  - Tricking your brain into learning more
- Framing learning process is critical
  - not penalizing someone in any way for a failed attempt proved influential in # of attempts and success rate
- Super Mario Analogy
  - focusing on obective vs. failure
  - repeat remembering failures intending to move forward

## Discussion Questions

### What's one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- In a word, 'marketing.' My personal brand of customer-obsessed teamwork and inclusion. The value I bring to a team that no one else can is the confidence I give others that they're in good hands, and that choosing my team and I is the right decision for their needs and goals. I pride myself in connecting people in need with people who have solutions. I do this in a way few people can, given that few people have the interpersonal skills I possess.

### What are 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on tough pieces of code, logic, or features?

- Figure out what you actually told your program to do vs. what you thought you told it to do (Singer, problem solving article)
- Use my Google-Fu to research and solve sub-problems before tackling entire problem
- Break down problems I face into smaller sub-problems, beginning in order of simplest -> most complex.
