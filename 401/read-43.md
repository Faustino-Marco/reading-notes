[The Code I'm still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

The writer was asked to write something unethical in the year 2000. Apparently the author began writing code at 6 and worked coding into their career over time. They coded a quiz for a drug-company that fed the clients drug to users as an answer for nearly all responses. Someone who took the drug killed themselves the day they were set to celebrate. Developers are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices. THINK TWICE about the effects of your code!
