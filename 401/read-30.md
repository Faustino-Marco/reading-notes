## Reading 
[Intro to Hash Tables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)
- hash
    - result of some algo taking incoming string and converting into a vlue to be used for security or some other purpose
- buckets
    - buckets are contained in each index of the array of the hashtable
    - each index is a bucket
    - can potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if collision occurs
- Collision
    - when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable

### Why use hash tables?
- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

```
Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.
In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.
```

can sort strings at same or different indices
