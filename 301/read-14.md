1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  - personal computers became more and more accessible and commonplace in U.S. homes
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - early computers were mostly toys, pong/shooting games, marketed to men and boys
    - idea that cpu's are for boys became the narrative

  - when company leaders are committed drivers of said efforts
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - diverse approaches to problems present faster/better approaches to solution finding
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - relating to wider customer base and user base is made possible with representatives from diverse groups on the team.

  ## Things I'd like to know more about
  - I'd love to hear a woman in tech's opinion on whether or not the kind of games and apps that are introduced to young people do in fact play a role in upholding the narrative that computers are for boys. For example, is it because the early PC games and apps were 'pong' and 'shooting games' that boys picked them up as a reflection of gender narratives in general at that time, and if so, what kind of programs would have been "in-line" with gender narratives of that era to attract women and girls to computers as well as, or even instead of boys. 
  
  Furthermore, if there were comparatively or relatively more women in tech at that time, why weren't programs that would be more likely to draw female users to them developed on PC's? Is it possible that we literally didn't have computing power advanced enough to create games and apps that were complex enough to interest a female user-base? Men seem to be more easily entertained by simplistic features like pong and shooting, which might be easier to code than something that might be considered typically more interesting to female users.
