[How I explained REST to my Brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
  - Roy Fielding is someone that helped write the first web servers, sent documents across the internet, and researched the internet and its potential.
2. Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - Because they were designed to get specific machines to talk with one another, as opposed to all machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - It describes the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. (Like GPS coordinates).
4. What does a `GET` do?
  - used to retrieve
5. What does a `POST` do?
  - add something to another system
6. What does `PUT` do?
  - replace something in another system
7. What does `PATCH` do?
  - partial upadate in another system

## Things I want to know more about:
